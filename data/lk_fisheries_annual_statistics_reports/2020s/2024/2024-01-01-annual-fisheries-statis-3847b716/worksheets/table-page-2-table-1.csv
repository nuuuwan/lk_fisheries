"Note on Publication Title Change"
"Beginning with this edition, which presents fisheries data for the year 2024, we have adopted a new title"
"“Annual Fisheries Statistical Bulletin – 2024”."
"This change has been made to avoid duplication with our previous publication titled “Fisheries Statistics"
"2024,” which covered data for the year 2023. The new title reflects our commitment to clarity,"
"consistency, and the accurate representation of statistical periods in future releases."
"We will continue publishing subsequent annual fisheries data under this updated title format to ensure"
"continuity and improved accessibility for our users."
